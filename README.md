# medialert
Java-based app designed to create alarms and remind users to take medications.

5-STAGE PROJECT:
1. PLANNING
   There are currently many outdated issues in the medical community that can be fixed using a web application. The two issues that I plan to combat, in particular, are as follows: there exists no easy way for patients to plan and take their medications, and there exists no easy way to recommend alternative medications to common over-the-counter medications. Thus, MediAlert plans to combat both of these issues.
   Coding language: Java, as it can utilize basic HTML, contains many similarities to C++ which I am familiar with, and can be applied to both mobile and web applications without translation from one language to another. Moreover, Java is a well-established coding language with many libraries, allowing for generally easier implementation of higher-level functions (i.e., java clock detects current times around the world).
   Business Scope: to create an app ported to the Google Store
   Difficulties: An algorithm that can recommend similar medications to other pharmaceuticals needs both historical data and expertise, of which neither can be applied within the current scope of the project. Moreover, the current algorithm detects similarities in chemical formulas; however, many complex chemical formulas can have vastly different three-dimensional architectures, and thus, chemical similarities cannot be the only criteria.
   Functions: Java clock, alarm clock/reminder system, prescription calculator, alternative medication algorithm
